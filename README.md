# GIBBERISH!
This is a repo for the main project of Metropolia UAS course "Web Based Mobile Applications." If you want to test the demo app, clone this repo and run `npm install` on your preferred bash to install all the dependencies. `npm start` runs the expo tes server. The app is not designed to run in a browser so to try it out, use an android emulator (android studio) or an IOS simulator (Xcode). To try the app on your phone, download the free expo app and use the QR-code found on the Expo Developer Tools.
