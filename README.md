# GIBBERISH!
This is a repo for the main project of Metropolia UAS course "Web Based Mobile Applications." If you want to test the demo app, clone this repo and run `npm install` on your preferred bash to install all the dependencies. `npm start` runs the expo tes server. The app is not designed to run in a browser so to try it out, use an android emulator (android studio) or an IOS simulator (Xcode). To try the app on your phone, download the free expo app and use the QR-code found on the Expo Developer Tools.

## The Idea
The app is an "antisocial" social media app, in which the user can upload images or video and, upon the app "analysing" the uploaded media, generate some tonal gibberish. Apart from the uploaded media, the app is presented in a delicious monochrome retro look.

## The Reality
Achieving a pixelated retro look using modern frameworks and component libraries turned out to be surprisingly hard. The scope of the project forced us to make compromises to improve the usability and overall feel of the app. Some functionalities were left out due to time constraints. We also wanted to make sure that the features present in the prototype app were thorougly tested.
