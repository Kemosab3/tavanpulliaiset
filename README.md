# Gibberish!

This is a mobile app project for the Metropolia UAS course Web Based Mobile Applications.
The project was created using React Native Expo and the React Native Paper & React Native Elements
component libraries.

The app is designed around a media sharing functionality, that allows the user to generate
short semi-random soundscapes, or "gibberish" from uploaded media (pictures or video). The
sounds are generated based on the stringified version of the file's content.

The other core feature of the app is it's retro feel and look.

  ## Target group
The App is geared towards human beings in their 40's and 50's, who are into retro computers
and experimental electronic music. Satellite target groups include people who are interested
in content creation apps.

As a fun note, during the testing the look and feel of the app was seen as appealing by only those
in the immediate target group.
  ## Installation & Deployment

To try out the app, get the repo from https://github.com/Kemosab3/tavanpulliaiset by either
downloading it straight from GitHub or by cloning it in your preferred terminal/bash.

When in the project folder, run

```bash
npm -i
```

to install dependencies.

You will also need the Expo Go -app on your mobile device (preferrably a cell phone) which can be
downloaded fron App Store (iOS) or Google Play (android).

To start the app, navigate to the app root folder and run

```bash
npm start
```

This opens up a dialogue
in the terminal and a new tab in your web browser, which both contain a QR. Scan it with
your mobile device to start testing the app.

*Take into consideration that the used back-end is run on Metropolia servers and is not an
official part of this project or replicable using this repo.*
